  Mayflower's Delight is an addon for the popular Minecraft Mod "Farmer's Delight" by VectorWing. It's goal is to add an interesting assortment of Old World and New World crops, drastically expanding the culinary options of Farmer's Delights and other addons. 

  Mayflower's Delight is designed with the idea of modpacks in mind. As such, there is quite a number of optional dependencies to include:
  - Eating Animations [In Progress]
  - Overweight Crops [In Progress]
  - Alex's Mobs [Not Yet Implemented]
  - Realistic Bees [Not Yet Implemented]

Although fairly planned out already, we are always open to feature suggestions, which can be placed on either our Curseforge Page or Modrinth. At this time, we do nut have a Discord channel and do not plan on making one. 

Fair winds and following seas!
